          OASIS requests that any OASIS Party or any other party that believes it has patent claims
          that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this OASIS Committee
          Specification or OASIS Standard, to notify OASIS TC Administrator and provide an
          indication of its willingness to grant patent licenses to such patent claims in a manner
          consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Technical Committee that produced this
          specification.

          OASIS invites any party to contact the OASIS TC Administrator if it is aware of a claim of
          ownership of any patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of
          this specification by a patent holder that is not willing to provide a license to such
          patent claims in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Technical Committee
          that produced this specification. OASIS may include such claims on its website, but
          disclaims any obligation to do so.

          OASIS takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any intellectual property or
          other rights that might be claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the
          technology described in this document or the extent to which any license under such rights
          might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it has made any effort to
          identify any such rights. Information on OASIS' procedures with respect to rights in any
          document or deliverable produced by an OASIS Technical Committee can be found on the OASIS
          website. Copies of claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of
          licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to obtain a general
          license or permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or users of
          this OASIS Committee Specification or OASIS Standard, can be obtained from the OASIS TC
          Administrator. OASIS makes no representation that any information or list of intellectual
          property rights will at any time be complete, or that any claims in such list are, in
          fact, Essential Claims.
