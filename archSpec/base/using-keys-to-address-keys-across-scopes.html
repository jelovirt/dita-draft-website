        <dd class="dd">

        <p class="p">
          The key space that is associated with a key scope also includes all key definitions from
          its parent key scope. If a key name is defined in both a key scope and its parent scope,
          the key definition in the parent scope takes precedence. This means that a key definition
          in a parent scope overrides all definitions for the same key name in all descendant
          scopes. This enables map authors to override the keys that are defined in submaps,
          regardless of whether the submaps define key scopes.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          In certain complex cases, a scope-qualified key name (such as
          <span class="keyword">scope.key</span>) can override an unqualified key name from the
          parent scope. See
          <a
            class="xref"
            href="example-keys-scope-defining-precedence.html"
            title="For purposes of key definition precedence, the scope-qualified key definitions from a child scope are considered to occur at the location of the scope-defining element within the parent scope."

          >.

      <section class="section" id="concept_art_5ps_sr__keys-in-child-key-scope">
        <h2 class="title sectiontitle">Keys that are defined in child key scopes</h2>

        <p class="p">
          The key space associated with a key scope does not include the
          <em class="ph i">unqualified</em> key definitions from the child scopes. However, it does
          include scope-qualified keys from the child scopes. This enables sibling key scopes to
          have different key definitions for the same key name.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          A <dfn class="term">scope-qualified key name</dfn> is a key name, prepended by one or more
          key scope names <span class="ph">and separated by periods</span>. For example, to
          reference a key "keyName" defined in a child scope named "keyScope", specify
          <code class="ph codeph">keyref="keyScope.keyName"</code>.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          If a key scope has multiple names, its keys can be addressed from its parent scope using
          any of the scope names. For example, if a key scope is defined with
          <code class="ph codeph">keyscope="a b c"</code>, and it contains a key name of "product",
          that key can be referenced from the parent scope by
          <code class="ph codeph">keyref="a.product"</code>,
          <code class="ph codeph">keyref="b.product"</code>, or
          <code class="ph codeph">keyref="c.product"</code>
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          Because a child scope contributes its scope-qualified keys to its parent scope, and that
          parent scope contributes <em class="ph i">its</em> scope-qualified keys to
          <em class="ph i">its</em> parent scope, it is possible to address the keys in any
          descendant scope by using the scope-qualified key name. For example, consider a key scope
          named "ancestorScope" that has a child scope named "parentScope" which in turn has a child
          scope named "childScope". The scope "childScope" defines a key named "keyName". To
          reference the key "keyName" from scope "ancestorScope", specify the scope-qualified key
          name: <code class="ph codeph">keyref="parentScope.childScope.keyName"</code>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="section" id="concept_art_5ps_sr__keys-in-sibling-key-scope">
        <h2 class="title sectiontitle">Keys that are defined in sibling key scopes</h2>

        <p class="p">
          Because a parent key scope contains scope-qualified keys from all of its child scopes, and
          a child scope inherits all of the key definitions (including scope-qualified keys) from
          its parent scope, it is possible for a child scope to reference its own scope-qualified
          keys, as well as those defined by its sibling scopes.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          For example, consider two sibling scopes, "scope1" and "scope2". Each scope defines the
          key "productName". References to "productName" in each scope resolve to the local
          definition. However, since each scope inherits the scope-qualified keys that are available
          in their parent scope, either scope can reference "scope1.productName" and
          "scope2.productName" to refer to the scope-specific definitions for that key.
