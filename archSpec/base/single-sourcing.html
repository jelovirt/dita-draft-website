      Producing different deliverables from a single source
    </h1>

    <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="shortdesc">
        DITA is designed to enable the production of multiple deliverable formats from a single set
        of DITA content. This means that many rendition details are specified neither in the DITA
        specification nor in the DITA content; the rendition details are defined and controlled by
        the processors.
      </p>
      <div class="p">
        Like many XML-based applications for human-readable documentation, DITA supports the
        separation of content from presentation. This is necessary when content is used in different
        contexts, since authors cannot predict how or where the material that they author will be
        used. The following features and mechanisms enable users to produce different deliverable
        formats from a single source:
        <dl class="dl">
          <dt class="dt dlterm">DITA maps</dt>
          <dd class="dd">
            Different DITA maps can be optimized for different delivery formats. For example, you
            might have a book map for printed output and another DITA map to generate online help;
            each map uses the same content set.
          </dd>

          <dt class="dt dlterm">Specialization</dt>

          <dd class="dd">
            The DITA specialization facility enables users to create XML elements that can provide
            appropriate rendition distinctions. Because the use of specializations does not impede
            interchange or interoperability, DITA users can safely create the specializations that
            are demanded by their local delivery and rendition requirements, with a minimum of
            additional impact on the systems and business processes that depend on or use the
            content. While general XML practices suggest that element types should be semantic,
            specialization can be used to define element types that are purely presentational in
            nature. The highlighting domain is an example of such a specialization.
          </dd>

          <dt class="dt dlterm">Conditional processing</dt>
          <dd class="dd">
            Conditional processing makes it possible to have a DITA topic or map that contains
            delivery-specific content.
          </dd>

          <dt class="dt dlterm">Content referencing</dt>
          <dd class="dd">
            The conref mechanism makes it possible to construct delivery-specific maps or topics
            from a combination of generic components and delivery-context-specific components.
          </dd>

          <dt class="dt dlterm">Key referencing</dt>
          <dd class="dd">
            The keyref mechanism makes it possible to have key words be displayed differently in
            different deliverables. It also allows a single link to resolve to different targets in
            different deliverables.
          </dd>

          <dt class="dt dlterm">
            <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@outputclass</code> attribute
          </dt>
          <dd class="dd">
            The <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@outputclass</code> attribute provides a
            mechanism whereby authors can indicate specific rendition intent where necessary. Note
            that the DITA specification does not define any values for the
            <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@outputclass</code> attribute; the use of the
            <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@outputclass</code> attribute is processor
            specific.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </div>
      <p class="p">
        While DITA is independent of any particular delivery format, it is a standard that supports
        the creation of human-readable content. As such, it defines some fundamental document
        components including paragraphs, lists, and tables. When there is a reasonable expectation
        that such basic document components be rendered consistently, the DITA specification defines
        default or suggested renderings.
