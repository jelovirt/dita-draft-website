description: 'The Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) is an XML-based architecture for
        authoring, producing, and delivering topic-oriented, information-typed content that can be
        reused and single-sourced in a variety of ways. While DITA historically has been driven by
        the requirements of large-scale technical documentation authoring, management, and delivery,
        it is a standard that is applicable to any kind of publication or information that might be
        presented to readers, including interactive training and educational materials, standards,
        reports, business documents, trade books, travel and nature guides, and more. '

    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) is an XML-based architecture for
        authoring, producing, and delivering topic-oriented, information-typed content that can be
        reused and single-sourced in a variety of ways. While DITA historically has been driven by

        <p class="p">DITA is designed for creating new document types and describing new information domains
            based on existing types and domains. The process for creating new types and domains is
            called specialization. Specialization enables the creation of specific, targeted XML
            grammars that can still use tools and design rules that were developed for more general
            types and domains; this is similar to how classes in an object-oriented system can
            inherit the methods of ancestor classes.</p>
        <p class="p">Because DITA topics are conforming XML documents, they can be readily viewed, edited, and
            validated using standard XML tools, although realizing the full potential of DITA
            requires using DITA-aware tools.</p>
