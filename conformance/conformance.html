    the conditions that are described in Section 4.1. A document is a conforming DITA document if the

<p class="p">Conformance to the DITA specification allows documents and document types that are used with
different processors to produce the same or similar results with little or no reimplementation or
modification. Conformance also allows DITA specializations to work with any conforming DITA
application, with at least the same level of support available to unspecialized documents.</p>

<p class="p">The DITA specification defines several core features, as summarized in the following list. Any
implementation that supports a feature <dfn class="term RFC-2119">MUST</dfn> conform to all rules
laid out in the section that describes the feature.</p>

<p class="p">Conforming DITA implementations <dfn class="term RFC-2119">SHOULD</dfn> include a conformance
statement that gives the version of the DITA specification that is supported, indicate if all
features from the list above are supported, and indicate that all normative rendering rules are
supported.</p>
<p class="p">If only a subset of features is supported, implementations <dfn class="term RFC-2119">SHOULD</dfn> indicate which features are (or are not) supported. If an implementation supports
rendering DITA elements but does not render all elements as described above, that application <dfn class="term RFC-2119">SHOULD</dfn> indicate which elements are (or are not) supported.</p>
<p class="p">Not all DITA features are relevant for all implementations. For example, a DITA editor that does
        not render content references in context does not need to conform to rules regarding the
          <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@conref</code> attribute. However, any application that renders content
        references <dfn class="term RFC-2119">MUST</dfn> conform to the rules described in<a class="xref" href="../archSpec/base/conref.html" title="The DITA conref attributes provide mechanisms for reusing content.

<p class="p">Implementations that support only a subset of DITA features are considered conforming as long as
all supported features follow the requirements that are given in the DITA specification. An
implementation that does not support a particular feature <dfn class="term RFC-2119">MUST</dfn>
be prepared to interoperate with other implementations that do support the feature.</p>
