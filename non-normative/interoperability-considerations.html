        The DITA specification does not require processors to perform filtering, content reference
        resolution, key space construction, and other processing related to base DITA semantics in
        any particular order. This means that different conforming DITA processors
        <span class="ph">might</span> produce different results for the same initial data set and
        filtering conditions. DITA users and DITA implementers need to be aware of these potential
        differences in behavior when DITA content will be processed by different processors.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        In general, in any situation in which two elements interact during processing, applying
        filtering before or after the processing is done <span class="ph">can</span> result in
        different results when either or both of the elements is conditional.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        For conditional elements, an element is "applicable" if it is filtered in and "inapplicable"
        if it is filtered out.
      </p>
      <section class="section" id="nteroperability-considerations__filtering-and-conref-resolution">
        <h2 class="title sectiontitle">Filtering and content reference resolution</h2>

        <p class="p">
          When two elements are merged as result of a content reference, the attributes of the two
          elements are combined. By default, the attributes of the referencing element take
          precedence over the referenced element. However, any attribute can specify the value
          "-dita-use-conref-target", which causes the referenced element attribute to take
          precedence. This means that the effective value of filtering attributes might reflect
          either the referencing element or the referenced element depending on how each attribute
          is configured on the referencing element. This in turn means that, in certain cases,
          filtering before resolving content references will produce a different result than when
          filtering is applied after resolving content references.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          In two cases, the order in which filtering is applied results in either an element being
          in the effective result or an element not being in the effective result. There is a third
          case in which there will be either an empty element (and unresolvable content reference)
          or no element.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          In the case where a referenced element is not applicable and the referencing element is
          explicitly applicable for the same condition (that is, both elements specify values for
          the same filtering attribute and the referencing element is applicable), if content
          references are resolved <em class="ph i">before</em> filtering, the content reference is
          resolved and the effective value of the referencing element reflects the referenced
          element. If content referencing is resolved <em class="ph i">after</em> filtering, the
          referenced element is filtered out and the content reference cannot be resolved, typically
          generating an error.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          The same scenario results in different results for the case of conref push. An applicable,
          referencing element can use conref push to replace another element that would otherwise be
          filtered out. If content references are resolved <em class="ph i">before</em> filtering,
          the content is pushed and the effective value of the referenced element reflects the
          referencing element. If content referencing is resolved
          <em class="ph i">after</em> filtering, the referenced element will be filtered out and the
          content reference can no longer be resolved.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          If the referencing element is not conditional and the referenced element is inapplicable,
          filtering applied before content reference resolution results in an unresolvable content
          reference. If filtering is applied after content resolution, the explicit condition on the
          referenced element becomes the effective value for that condition following content
          resolution and the result is then filtered out. The difference in these two cases is that
          in the first case the content reference cannot be resolved, resulting in a processing
          error and a potentially nonsensical element if the referencing element has required
          subelements (for example, a content reference from a topic to another topic, where the
          referencing topic must have a title subelement), but in the second case the element is
          filtered completely out.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          Different processing orders might also provide different results in the case where pushed
          content is wrapped in an element that is filtered out. If filtering is applied before
          content resolution, that entire block of content (the wrapper and the content to be
          pushed) is filtered out before the content reference is resolved. If filtering is applied
          after content resolution, the push action will be resolved first so that content appears
          in the referenced location, after which the referencing element (along with its wrapper)
          is filtered from the original source location.

          <a

          for a discussion of effective key definitions and conditional processing.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          As an implementation detail for key-space-constructing processors, if filtering is applied
          before constructing the key space, then the set of effective key definitions is simply the
          first definition of each unique key name. However, if filtering is applied after key space
          construction, and in particular, if a processor needs to allow dynamic resolution of keys
          based on different filtering specifications applied to the same constructed key space,
          then the set of effective key definitions is the first definition of each pair of unique
          key name and unique selection specification set. This second form of constructed key space
          would be needed by processors such as editors and content management systems that need to
          quickly provide different filtering-specific key bindings without reconstructing the
          entire key space for each new set of filtering conditions.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          For example, given a map that contains two definitions for the key "topic-01", one with an
          <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@audience</code> value of "expert" and one with an
          <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@audience</code> value of "novice", a filter-first
          processor would only have at most one effective key definition for the key name
          "topic-01", whichever of the two definitions was filtered in by the active filter
          specification and was the first definition encountered (if both happen to be filtered in).
          In a processor that supports dynamic key definition filtering, there would be two
          effective definitions for the key name "topic-01", one for
          <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@audience</code> of "expert" and one for
          <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@audience</code> of "novice". The processor would
          also need to maintain knowledge of the definition order of the two key definitions in
          order to correctly handle the case when both "expert" and "novice" are applicable for a
          given key access request (in which case, whichever of the two definitions was first would
          be used as the effective value of the key).

        <p class="p">
          If a cross reference, link, or other linking element is resolved to its target before
          filtering and the target is subsequently filtered out, the link would be to a non-existent
          target but might reflect properties of the target (for example, a cross reference link
          text might reflect the target title). If the link is resolved after filtering is applied
          and the target is filtered out, the link is to a non-existent target, which will result in
          a different link text. The rendition effect for the navigation link is the same: the link
          cannot be navigated because the target does not exist in the rendered result.

          Resolution of <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;topicref&gt;</code> elements
